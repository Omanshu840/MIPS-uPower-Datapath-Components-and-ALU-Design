This Assignment is divided in two parts : MIPS and UPower.

The MIPS folder contains : 

1. 32-bit ALU : which is the ALU used for MIPS.
2. ALU Control Unit : decides what operation is to be performed by the ALU.
3. Branch on Equal : it implements the BEQ instructions.
4. Instruction Fetch Hardware : Its used to get the instruction from the binary file.
5. I-type Instructions : Its implementation for the different Immediate instructions.
6. Load-Store Instructions : It implements the load and store instructions.
7. R-type Instructions : It implements the different R-type Instructions. 

The UPower folder contains :

1. 64-bit ALU : which is the ALU used for UPower.
2. ALU Control Unit : decides what operation is to be performed by the ALU.
3. D-format Instructions : It implements the different D-type Instructions.
4. DS-format Instructions : It implements the different DS-type Instructions.
5. Instruction Fetch Hardware : Its used to get the instruction from the binary file.
6. X-Format Instructions  : It implements the different X-type Instructions.
7. XO-format Instructions : It implements the different XO-type Instructions.
